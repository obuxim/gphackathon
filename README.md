#BlendX

It's not about one single project or single hackathon. BlendX architecture can work with any language or framework and Blend all the messy Validation logics, Custom Controllers and Eliminate repetition of code extremely.

The most important thing about BlendX is it can reduce backend and API development timelines in half.

I also have a version which generates dashboards automatically. You can check here: [Larablend](https://github.com/obuxim/larablend)
